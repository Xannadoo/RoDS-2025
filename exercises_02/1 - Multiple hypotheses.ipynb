    "This exercise consists of running simulations with three probabilities functions (normal, exponential and lognormal) to show that sample size is a major issue with the study of senescence and drops in performance: https://callingbullshit.org/case_studies/case_study_track_records.html\n",

    "The first step is to recreate the original line chart of Bergstrom & Dugatkin (2016) that shows world records decreasing by age. Since some records correspond to the lowest value (e.g., the 100m dash) while others correspond to the highest value (i.e., the longjump), we first define two functions to scale both types of records so we could compare different records if we wanted to."

For this, you need to generate samples of 100m dash times drawn from three different distributions: (1) normal, (2) exponential, and (3) log-normal. You could try out the following sample sizes: 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000. We recommend you do this using [inverse transform sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling)."
