# Generative AI Project
## Week 7: 11/03
If you haven't already, start planning your generative ai project

## Week 8: 18/03
Finish designing study, gather data, start analysis

## Week 9: 25/03
Finish analysis, discuss results, start the report

## Week 10: 01/04
Finish the report

## Week 11: 08/04
Catch up session - this is the final exercise session so ask us anything (preferably course related)

***
## Week 12 & 14: 22/04 & 06/05
- Presentations:
  - You reflect on your bachelor thesis (alternatively second-year project). Use the concepts learned in the course to analyse your own work!
  - You have 5 mins per student (so if you are writing in a pair, you have 10mins), then you will get feedback to help your reflections.
  - The slide deck becomes part of your exam submission, you are free to update it before the handin. It is a good idea to include speaker notes/etc for anything that should be included that isn't explicitly on your slides. 
  - After both sessions, general feedback will be released on learnit.

## Week 13: 29/04
- No planned lecture or exercises this week.

# Exam stuff:
The exam submission is worked on **throughout** the semester (exam format C1G).

From LearnIt: 
> ... the exam submission is based on a three elements: (1) a BS journal that you can complete during the first half of the course, (2) and group project which will be developed throughout the second half of the course; and 3) a presentation where you reflect on your bachelor thesis (...) using concepts covered in the course.
